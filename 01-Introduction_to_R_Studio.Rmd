# Introduction to RStudio

## What is R
**R** is a type of programming language and supports many tasks including statistical computation (data cleaning, data management, [statistics](https://r-statistics.co/Linear-Regression.html), [machine learning](https://vtao1989.github.io/DisToTransit_statistics/)) and grapics ([static plots](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html) and [interactive plots](https://plot.ly/r/3d-surface-plots/)). You can also use it to create website, write papers, analyze texts, etc. The most important thing is that **R is free and easy to use**, that's why it has been applied in many fileds.

## What is R Studio
**RStudio** is a programming software for editing and running R code. It has many great features to make R programming easier and more fun!

## Install R + RStudio
For better coding and running R, you should install both R and RStudio. You could code R with the installation of R only, however, RStudio provides you with more conveinece during the working process. In this course, we will use RStudio to do all the course lectures and exercises. So please make sure you install both of them!  
R could be downloaded [here](https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio could be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Both Windows OS and Mac OS are supported, so please choose the one you need for your own system.  
Or you could use the computers in the lab when there is no lecture.

## Familiar with the user interface of R Studio
Below is a screenshot of the user interface of RStudio. You will find couple of panes/windows with different usages.

1. **Menu/Tool Bar**
2. **Source**  The pane where you write and edit your code.
3. **Environment/History** Environment lists all the variables that you are currently using. History presents the codes you have runned before.
4. **Console** Console is the original R interactive window. You could run codes and see the results here.
5. **Plots/Help** Plots window shows the output figures. Help windows presents the information of the function or package you check.

## Create and save R file
Three ways to create a R file in the RStudio:
```
1. Menu -> File -> New File -> R Script
2. Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N
3. Tool Bar -> New file button
```

Also three ways to save R file
```
1. Menu -> File -> Save
2. Shortcut: Ctrl + S
3. Tool Bar -> Save file button
```

## Print Hello, world
Now, let's try to input some codes and run them! Let's print the very classic "Hello, world!" with ``print()`` function.  
We could run the codes in several ways:

1. Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and click the Run button located in the right-top position of the console pane.
2. Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and use shortcut: Ctrl + Enter
3. You could also click the Re-run button near the Run button to re-run the codes you runned last time

```{r}
print('Hello, world!')
```

Because what we need to output here is a **string varible**, we have to put them in the quotation mark. Either single quotation or double quotation mark works well. Let's see another example.

```{r}
print(5928)
```

Here, 5928 is an integer and we do not need to put them in the quotation mark.

## Install and use R Packages
R is easy to use because it has many packages with different usages. These packages could help you acomplish some complex tasks with just several lines of codes.  
Some packages have been already been installed and you could use them directly, which are base packages. However, most of the packages have to be installed before you use them. There are couple of ways you could install a package. Let's take the ``gbm`` package for example.
```
1. Manu -> Tools -> Install Packages... -> Input the package name -> Click Install button
```
<center>
![](Pics/InstallPackages.JPG){ width=35% }
</center>

```
2. Use the code below:
install.packages("gbm")
```

After the installation of the package, you have import the it with ``library()`` function before you use the functions in it.
```{r}
library(gbm)
```

We will spend more time in the future classes to explore the various R packages and their different usages.

## Make notes
It is important to write notes for your codes. It could help others or even yourself understand your codes easily. Use hash tag to indicate the notes. For example,
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gbm1 <- gbm(AvgMet~PkAreaH+StpNumH+DisToMin,  # formula
            data=MetM,                        # dataset  
            var.monotone=c(+1, rep(0,10),rep(0,15)), 
            distribution="gaussian",          # see the help for other choices  
            n.trees=5000,                     # number of trees  
            shrinkage=0.001,                  # shrinkage or learning rate, 0.001 to 0.1 usually work  
            interaction.depth=6,              # 1: additive model, 2: two-way interactions, etc.  
            bag.fraction = 0.5,               # subsampling fraction, 0.5 is probably best  
            n.minobsinnode = 10,              # minimum total weight needed in each node
            cv.folds = 5)
```
R will not run the codes after hash tags in each line.

Please try to write simple but necessary notes for the codes. Keep this as a good habbit and you will thank yourself in the future.

## Tips (Updating)
1. You could divide your codes into sections by interting chunks before each sections with the shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + R. This will help you organize your codes.
2. Use ``?`` or ``help()`` function to find the related instruction or help page, for example, if you want to find the instruction of ``library()`` function, just
```
?library
```
or
```
help(library)
```
Both will direct you to the instruction page you are looking for.
