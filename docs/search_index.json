You can also use it to create website (like this course website), write papers, analyze texts, etc. The most important thing is that R is free and easy to use, that’s why it has been applied in many fileds. 2.2 What is RStudio RStudio is a programming software for editing and running R code. It has many great features to make R programming easier! 2.3 Install R + RStudio For better coding and running R, you should install both R and RStudio. You could code R with the installation of R only, however, RStudio provides you with more conveinece in coding. In this course, we will use RStudio to do all the course lectures and exercises. So please make sure you install both of them! R could be downloaded here and RStudio could be downloaded here. Both Windows OS (Operating System) and Mac OS are supported, so please choose the right one you need for your own system. (If you have any questions about the installation of R or RStudio, please come to me in the office hours or ask IT for help) Or you could use the computers in the lab when there is no lecture. 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of RStudio Below is a screenshot of the user interface of RStudio. You will find couple of panes/windows with different usages.(Selvam 2019) Menu/Tool Bar Source The pane where you write and edit your codes. Environment/History Environment lists all the variables that you are currently using. History presents the codes you have runned before. Console Console is the original R interactive window. You could run codes and see the results here. Plot/Help Plot window shows the output figures. Help window presents the information of the function or package you are checking. 2.5 Create and save R file Three ways to create a R file in the RStudio: 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N 3. Tool Bar -&gt; New file button Also three ways to save R file 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; Save 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + S 3. Tool Bar -&gt; Save file button 2.6 Print Hello, world Now, let’s try to code something and run them! Let’s print the very classic “Hello, world!” with print() function. We could run the codes in several ways: Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and click the Run button located in the right-top position of the source pane. Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and use shortcut: Ctrl + Enter You could also click the Re-run button near the Run button to re-run the codes you ran last time. print(&#39;Hello, world!&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Because what we need to output here is a string varible, we have to put them in the quotation mark. Either single quotation or double quotation mark works well. Let’s see another example. print(5928) ## [1] 5928 Here, 5928 is an integer and we do not need to put them in the quotation marks. 2.7 Install and use R Packages R is easy to use because it has many packages with different usages. These packages could help you accomplish some complex tasks with just several lines of codes. Some packages have been already been installed and you could use them directly, which are base packages. However, most of the packages have to be installed before you use them. There are couple of ways you could install a package. Let’s take the gbm package for example. 1. Manu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Install Packages... -&gt; Input the package name -&gt; Click Install button 2. Use the code below: install.packages(&quot;gbm&quot;) After the installation of the package, you have import it with library() function before you use the related functions. library(gbm) ## Loaded gbm 2.1.5 We will spend more time in future classes to explore the various R packages and their different usages. 2.8 Make notes It is important to write notes for your codes. It could help others or even yourself understand your codes easily. Use hash tag to indicate the notes. For example, gbm1 &lt;- gbm(AvgMet~PkAreaH+StpNumH+DisToMin, # formula data=MetM, # dataset var.monotone=c(+1, rep(0,10),rep(0,15)), distribution=&quot;gaussian&quot;, # see the help for other choices n.trees=5000, # number of trees shrinkage=0.001, # shrinkage or learning rate, 0.001 to 0.1 usually work interaction.depth=6, # 1: additive model, 2: two-way interactions, etc. bag.fraction = 0.5, # subsampling fraction, 0.5 is probably best n.minobsinnode = 10, # minimum total weight needed in each node cv.folds = 5) R will not run the codes after hash tags in each line. Please try to write simple but necessary notes for the codes. Keep this as a good habbit and you will thank yourself in the future. 2.9 Tips You could divide your codes into sections by enterting chunks before each sections with the shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + R. This will help you organize your codes. Use ? or help() function to find the related instruction or help page, for example, if you want to find the instruction of library() function, just code ?library or help(library) Both will direct you to the instruction page you are looking for in the help window.

["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction to R 3.1 Variable types (Blischak et al. 2019) 3.2 Operations (tutorialspoint 2019) 3.3 Data types (Kabacoff 2019) 3.4 Conditional statements 3.5 Loops 3.6 Functions", " Chapter 3 Introduction to R 3.1 Variable types (Blischak et al. 2019) There are several variables which R could recoganise. Here, we use class() function to check the type of each value. Charactor class(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Numeric (real or decimal) class(59.28) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Integer (L tells R that this number is an integer) class(2L) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Logical class(TRUE) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; class(FALSE) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Complex (complex number, is a type of number, with respect to real number) class(1+4i) ## [1] &quot;complex&quot; It is important to know clearly what is the type of the variable you are using because different types of variables may have different methods to be dealed with. Another caveat is that the outlook of the variable may not show its real variable type. For example, a common situation is that a variable contains numbers could be charactor. class(&quot;59.28&quot;) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Here, the number has a quotation number, which means it has been transferred to type charactor. Therefore, please be careful about this! 3.2 Operations (tutorialspoint 2019) 3.2.1 Assignment operations Left assignment a &lt;- 1 b &lt;&lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; c = c(1, 3, 4) Right assignment 1 -&gt; a 2 -&gt;&gt; b 3.2.2 Arithmetic operations Add 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 Subtract 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Multiple 3 * 5 ## [1] 15 Divide 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Power 5 ^ 2 ## [1] 25 Mode 5 %% 2 ## [1] 1 3.2.3 Relational operations Larger 3 &gt; 4 ## [1] FALSE 5 &gt; 3 ## [1] TRUE Smaller 3 &lt; 5 ## [1] TRUE 4 &lt; 2 ## [1] FALSE Equal 4 == 4 ## [1] TRUE 5 == 4 ## [1] FALSE No less than (larger or equal to) 3 &gt;= 4 ## [1] FALSE 3 &gt;= 2 ## [1] TRUE No larger than (samller or equal to) 5 &lt;= 2 ## [1] FALSE 5 &lt;= 5 ## [1] TRUE Not equal 3 != 4 ## [1] TRUE 3.2.4 Logical operations And TRUE &amp; TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE &amp; TRUE ## [1] FALSE FALSE &amp; FALSE ## [1] FALSE Or TRUE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | FALSE ## [1] FALSE Not ! TRUE ## [1] FALSE ! FALSE ## [1] TRUE 3.3 Data types (Kabacoff 2019) Vetor You could create a vetor by using c() function. a &lt;- c(5, 9, 2, 8) # create a numeric vector a # show the value of this vetor ## [1] 5 9 2 8 b &lt;- c(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;, &#39;!&#39;) # charactor vector b ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c &lt;- c(5, &#39;good&#39;) # if you create a vector containing mixed variable types, such as numeric and charactor, R will restrict them to be the same variable type, here, charactor c ## [1] &quot;5&quot; &quot;good&quot; You could select elements in the vetor by using varaible[#]. a[3] # select the 3rd element ## [1] 2 b[1:3] # select from the 1st to the 3rd element ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c[2] # select the 2nd element ## [1] &quot;good&quot; Matrice You could create a matrix using matrix() function. a &lt;- matrix(1:6, # the data to be put in the matrix, here we use numbers from 1 to 6 nrow = 2, # number of rows in the matrix ncol = 3, # number of columns in the matrix byrow = FALSE) # how to put the data in the matrix, FALSE means by columns, TURE means by rows. a ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 For variable selection, the intuitive way is using coordinates. a[2,3] # select the elements in the 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 6 You could also select the entire row or column. a[,2] # the 2nd column ## [1] 3 4 a[1,] # the 1st row ## [1] 1 3 5 Data frame Data frame is a frequently-used data type in R. It could include columns with different types of values stored in them. Let’s create a dataframe with mixed variables types using data.frame() function. ID &lt;- c(1:4) # create variable ID Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;) # create variable Name Score &lt;- c(69.5, 77.5, 81.5, 90) # create variable Score df &lt;- data.frame(ID, Name, Score) # combine the varibles into one data frame called df df ## ID Name Score ## 1 1 A 69.5 ## 2 2 B 77.5 ## 3 3 C 81.5 ## 4 4 D 90.0 We created a data frame stored the students’ ID, name, and their test scores. If we want to select elements from this data frame, there are couple of ways. df[2,3] # 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 77.5 df[&#39;ID&#39;] # column of variable ID ## ID ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 df[c(&#39;ID&#39;, &#39;Score&#39;)] # column of ID and Score ## ID Score ## 1 1 69.5 ## 2 2 77.5 ## 3 3 81.5 ## 4 4 90.0 There is another way to select the column by its name. When you type $ after the data frame name, the RStudio will list all the variable names in that columns and makes it easier to choose the variable you want. It is more commonly used. df$Name # column of variable Name ## [1] A B C D ## Levels: A B C D List List could store mixed types of values. a &lt;- list(ID = 1, Name = &#39;A&#39;, Score = 69.5) a ## $ID ## [1] 1 ## ## $Name ## [1] &quot;A&quot; ## ## $Score ## [1] 69.5 Factor Factor is the nominal variable in R. This type will be very useful when we want to analyize data from different groups, such as gender. a &lt;- c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1) class(a) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; afactor &lt;- factor(a) class(afactor) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; 3.4 Conditional statements Conditional statement, also known as if statement. if (test_expression){ statement_1 } else { statement_2 } If the test_expression returns TRUE, then the codes will contitue to statement_1, if it returns FALSE, the codes will continue to statement_2. You could also omit the else part. if (test_expression){ statement_1 } If the test_expression returns FALSE, the codes will continue to next line. x &lt;- 5 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } else { print(&#39;x is not larger than 3&#39;) } ## [1] &quot;x is larger than 3&quot; x &lt;- 1 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } 3.5 Loops Loops help us repeat the codes we want. for (range){ statement } range will provide the range for a variable. for (i in 1:3){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 3.6 Functions Functions are codes have been defined with specific usage. You only need to input some necessary variables and functions will do the tasks and return the result. For example, sum() function could help you add the all the numbers in a list or dataframe and return the sum. sum(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 20 Another example is mean() function could help you average the numbers in a list or data frame and reture the mean value. mean(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 5 It is important to use the right function to do the right task. To do this, you have to be familiar with the functions you are using. It needs more practice. References "],
