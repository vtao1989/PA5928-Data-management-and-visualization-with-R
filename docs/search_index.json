Use of R Studio to carry out R file and related dataset management functions. Tools and techniques for data analysis and statistical programming in quantitative research or related applied areas. Topics include data selection, data manipulation, and data visualization (including charts, plots, histograms, maps, and other graphs). 1.2 Course Prerequisites Introductory statistics; ability to create bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots in MS Excel; and familiarity with principles of data visualization. 1.3 Logistics Instructor: Tao Tao, taotao@umn.edu Location: HHH 85 Time: Starting 10/8: Tuesdays 9:45AM to 11:00AM Office hours: Monday Friday 10:00 - 11:00 am at HHH 271 Canvas: All course notes will be posted in this course website, but links will be provided on Canvas. Canvas will also be used to submit your homework, final project, and grades. So you only need to pay attention to Canvas to check everything! 1.4 Course Learning Outcomes At the end of this course, students will be able to: Use R Studio to carry out R file and related dataset management Use R to work with different types of datasets and conduct basic data management Use R to visualize data with different types of plots 1.5 In-class exercise and final project An in-class exercise will be assigned during each class for the students to practice what they have learned. Chime will be used in class to check the class performance in a anonymous way. The in-class exercises will be mostly finished during the class time, and students are still required to submit their codes on the same day with necessary notes to indicate their ideas. Students will use the knowledge from this course to complete a final project (data analysis for a interested research question and write a short report about it). Grading policy In-class exercise codes: 60% Final project: 40% 1.6 Course Schedule (Tentative) # Date Topic Notes 1 10/8 Introduction to R Studio Uploaded 2 10/15 Introduction to R 3 10/22 Data manipulation with dplyr (I) 4 10/29 Data manipulation with dplyr (II) 5 11/5 Data visualization with ggplot2 (I) 6 11/12 Data visualization with ggplot2 (II) 7 11/19 R Statistics (I) 8 11/26 R Statistics (II) 9 12/3 Spatial visualization (I) 10 12/10 Spatial visualization (II) 1.7 Homework and projects collaboration and submission policy Students can discuss their works with other students, but must code and write up notes by themselves Plagiarism is not allowed by the university policies. Please do be careful about this. In-class exercises and projects should be submitted through Canvas. Late homework will not be accepted!
