["introduction-to-rstudio.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to RStudio 2.1 What is R 2.2 What is RStudio 2.3 Install R + RStudio 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of RStudio 2.5 Create and save R file 2.6 Print Hello, world 2.7 Install and use R Packages 2.8 Make notes 2.9 Tips", " Chapter 2 Introduction to RStudio In this chapter, we will go through some basic operations of RStudio. 2.1 What is R R is a type of programming language and supports many tasks including statistical computation (data cleaning, data management, statistics, machine learning) and graphics (static plots and interactive plots). You can also use it to create website (like this course website), write papers, analyze texts, etc. The most important thing is that R is free and easy to use, that’s why it has been applied in many fileds. 2.2 What is RStudio RStudio is a programming software for editing and running R code. It has many great features to make R programming easier! 2.3 Install R + RStudio For better coding and running R, you should install both R and RStudio. You could code R with the installation of R only, however, RStudio provides you with more conveinece in coding. In this course, we will use RStudio to do all the course lectures and exercises. So please make sure you install both of them! R could be downloaded here and RStudio could be downloaded here. Both Windows OS (Operating System) and Mac OS are supported, so please choose the right one you need for your own system. (If you have any questions about the installation of R or RStudio, please come to me in the office hours or ask IT for help) Or you could use the computers in the lab when there is no lecture. 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of RStudio Below is a screenshot of the user interface of RStudio. You will find couple of panes/windows with different usages.(Selvam 2019) Menu/Tool Bar Source The pane where you write and edit your codes. Environment/History Environment lists all the variables that you are currently using. History presents the codes you have runned before. Console Console is the original R interactive window. You could run codes and see the results here. Plot/Help Plot window shows the output figures. Help window presents the information of the function or package you are checking. 2.5 Create and save R file Three ways to create a R file in the RStudio: 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N 3. Tool Bar -&gt; New file button Also three ways to save R file 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; Save 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + S 3. Tool Bar -&gt; Save file button 2.6 Print Hello, world Now, let’s try to code something and run them! Let’s print the very classic “Hello, world!” with print() function. We could run the codes in several ways: Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and click the Run button located in the right-top position of the source pane. Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and use shortcut: Ctrl + Enter You could also click the Re-run button near the Run button to re-run the codes you ran last time. print(&#39;Hello, world!&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Because what we need to output here is a string varible, we have to put them in the quotation mark. Either single quotation or double quotation mark works well. Let’s see another example. print(5928) ## [1] 5928 Here, 5928 is an integer and we do not need to put them in the quotation marks. 2.7 Install and use R Packages R is easy to use because it has many packages with different usages. These packages could help you accomplish some complex tasks with just several lines of codes. Some packages have been already been installed and you could use them directly, which are base packages. However, most of the packages have to be installed before you use them. There are couple of ways you could install a package. Let’s take the gbm package for example. 1. Manu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Install Packages... -&gt; Input the package name -&gt; Click Install button 2. Use the code below: install.packages(&quot;gbm&quot;) After the installation of the package, you have import it with library() function before you use the related functions. library(gbm) ## Loaded gbm 2.1.5 We will spend more time in future classes to explore the various R packages and their different usages. 2.8 Make notes It is important to write notes for your codes. It could help others or even yourself understand your codes easily. Use hash tag to indicate the notes. For example, gbm1 &lt;- gbm(AvgMet~PkAreaH+StpNumH+DisToMin, # formula data=MetM, # dataset var.monotone=c(+1, rep(0,10),rep(0,15)), distribution=&quot;gaussian&quot;, # see the help for other choices n.trees=5000, # number of trees shrinkage=0.001, # shrinkage or learning rate, 0.001 to 0.1 usually work interaction.depth=6, # 1: additive model, 2: two-way interactions, etc. bag.fraction = 0.5, # subsampling fraction, 0.5 is probably best n.minobsinnode = 10, # minimum total weight needed in each node cv.folds = 5) R will not run the codes after hash tags in each line. Please try to write simple but necessary notes for the codes. Keep this as a good habbit and you will thank yourself in the future. 2.9 Tips You could divide your codes into sections by enterting chunks before each sections with the shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + R. This will help you organize your codes. Use ? or help() function to find the related instruction or help page, for example, if you want to find the instruction of library() function, just code ?library or help(library) Both will direct you to the instruction page you are looking for in the help window.

["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction to R 3.1 Variable types 3.2 Operations 3.3 Data structures 3.4 Conditional statements 3.5 Loops 3.6 Functions", " Chapter 3 Introduction to R A variable is used to store data including value, vector, data frame, etc, which R could use to manipulate (tutorialspoint 2019b). This chapter introduces variable types, operations between variables, data structures, conditional statements, loops, and functions. Before we start, let’s first see how to name a variable. The valid variable name could be constructed with letters, numbers, the dot character (.), and underline character (_). Besides that, a valid variable name should start with a letter or the dot charater not followed by a number. Examples Validity Discussion var.name ✓ var_name ✓ _var_name ☓ Cannot start with the underline .var_name ✓ var%name ☓ Cannot contain % .2var_name ☓ Cannot use the dot followed by a number to start with a variable name 2var_name ☓ Cannot start with a number 3.1 Variable types There are several types of variables which R could recognise, including character, numeric, integer, logical, and complex (Blischak et al. 2019). The type of one variable is decided by the type of value it stores. We can use class() function to check the type of each variable. Character (also known as strings) v &lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; class(v) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Numeric (real or decimal number/integer) v &lt;- 59.28 class(v) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Integer (L tells R that this number is an integer) v &lt;- 2L class(v) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; v &lt;-2 class(v) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Logical (Usually True or false) v &lt;- TRUE class(v) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; v &lt;- FALSE class(v) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Complex (complex number is another type of number, different with real number) v &lt;- 1 + 4i class(v) ## [1] &quot;complex&quot; It is important to know clearly what is the type of the variable you are using since different types of variables may have different methods to deal with. Another caveat is that the outlook of the variable may not show its real variable type. For example, a common situation is that a variable contains numbers could be characters. v &lt;- &quot;59.28&quot; class(v) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Here, the number has quotation marks outside, which means it has been transferred to type character. Therefore, please be careful about this! 3.2 Operations An operation tells R the mathematical or logical munipulations (tutorialspoint 2019a). 3.2.1 Assignment operations Assignment operators assign values to variables. Left assignment a &lt;- 1 b &lt;&lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; c = c(1, 3, 4) Right assignment 1 -&gt; a 2 -&gt;&gt; b 3.2.2 Arithmetic operations Add 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 Subtract 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Multiple 3 * 5 ## [1] 15 Divide 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Power 5 ^ 2 ## [1] 25 5 ** 2 # you can also do like this ## [1] 25 Mode (find the remainder) 5 %% 2 ## [1] 1 3.2.3 Relational operations The relational operators compare the two elements and return a logical value (TRUE or FALSE) Larger 3 &gt; 4 ## [1] FALSE 5 &gt; 3 ## [1] TRUE Smaller 3 &lt; 5 ## [1] TRUE 4 &lt; 2 ## [1] FALSE Equal 4 == 4 ## [1] TRUE 5 == 4 ## [1] FALSE No less than (larger or equal to) 3 &gt;= 4 ## [1] FALSE 3 &gt;= 2 ## [1] TRUE No larger than (samller or equal to) 5 &lt;= 2 ## [1] FALSE 5 &lt;= 5 ## [1] TRUE Not equal 3 != 4 ## [1] TRUE 3 != 3 ## [1] FALSE 3.2.4 Logical operations Logical operators are operations only for logical, numeric, or complex types. Most of the time, we apply them on logical values or variables. For numeric variables, 0 is considered FALSE and non-zero numbers are taken as TRUE (DataMentor 2019). You could use T for TRUE or F for FALSE as abbreviation. Logical And TRUE &amp; TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE &amp; TRUE ## [1] FALSE FALSE &amp; FALSE ## [1] FALSE Logical Or TRUE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | FALSE ## [1] FALSE Logical Not ! TRUE ## [1] FALSE ! FALSE ## [1] TRUE 3.3 Data structures Variables and values could construct different data structures including vector, matrix, data frame, list, and factor (Kabacoff 2019). Vetor You could create a vetor with c() function. a &lt;- c(5, 9, 2, 8) # create a numeric vector a # show the value of this vetor ## [1] 5 9 2 8 b &lt;- c(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;, &#39;!&#39;) # character vector b ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c &lt;- c(5, &#39;good&#39;) # if you create a vector containing mixed variable types, such as numeric and character, R will restrict them to be the same variable type, here, character c ## [1] &quot;5&quot; &quot;good&quot; You could select elements in the vetor by using var_name[#]. Please pay attention on how R indexes its elements in the data structure. a[3] # select the 3rd element ## [1] 2 b[1:3] # select from the 1st to the 3rd element ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c[1] # select the 2nd element ## [1] &quot;5&quot; 1:3 means from 1 to 3, so it actually stands for three numbers here, which are 1, 2, 3. Matrix You could create a matrix using matrix() function. a &lt;- matrix(1:6, # the data to be put in the matrix, here we use numbers from 1 to 6 nrow = 2, # number of rows in the matrix ncol = 3, # number of columns in the matrix byrow = FALSE) # how to put the data in the matrix, FALSE means by columns, TURE means by rows. a ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 For variable selection, the intuitive way is using coordinates. a[2,3] # select the elements in the 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 6 You could also select the entire row or column. a[ ,2] # the 2nd column ## [1] 3 4 a[1, ] # the 1st row ## [1] 1 3 5 Data frame Data frame is a frequently-used data type in R. It could include columns with different types of values stored in them. Let’s create a dataframe with mixed variables types using data.frame() function. ID &lt;- c(1:4) # create variable ID Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;) # create variable Name Score &lt;- c(69.5, 77.5, 81.5, 90) # create variable Score df &lt;- data.frame(ID, Name, Score) # combine the varibles into one data frame called df df ## ID Name Score ## 1 1 A 69.5 ## 2 2 B 77.5 ## 3 3 C 81.5 ## 4 4 D 90.0 We created a data frame stored the students’ ID, name, and their test scores. If we want to select elements from this data frame, there are couple of ways. df[2,3] # 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 77.5 df[&#39;ID&#39;] # column of variable ID ## ID ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 df[c(&#39;ID&#39;, &#39;Score&#39;)] # column of ID and Score ## ID Score ## 1 1 69.5 ## 2 2 77.5 ## 3 3 81.5 ## 4 4 90.0 There is another way to select the column by its name. When you type $ after the name of the data frame, RStudio will list all the variable names in that data frame which makes it easier to choose the variable you want. It is more commonly used. df$Name # column of variable Name ## [1] A B C D ## Levels: A B C D List A list could store mixed types of values, which is different from vetor. a &lt;- list(ID = c(1, 2), Name = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), Score = c(69.5, 89)) When you want to select elements from a list, you could do it in a similar way as a vector. However, list does not define row or column, so you cannot use 2-D coordinates to select elements like a data frame. a[1] ## $ID ## [1] 1 2 a[2:3] ## $Name ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## ## $Score ## [1] 69.5 89.0 Someone might be confusing since list looks silimar to data frame. Here is a good discussion about it. Due to the time limitation, we will not cover this discussion in class. The main idea is that list is more flexible than data frame, while data frame has more restrictions. However, since data frame is more similar to 2-D table structure which is more frequently used in our daily work. We apply data frame more than list. Factor Factor is the nominal variable in R. This type will be very useful when we want to analyze data from different groups, such as gender, school, etc. a &lt;- c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1) class(a) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; afactor &lt;- factor(a) class(afactor) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; 3.4 Conditional statements if (test_expression){ statement_1 } else { statement_2 } If the test_expression returns TRUE, then the codes will go to statement_1, if it returns FALSE, the codes will go to statement_2. You could also omit the else part. if (test_expression){ statement_1 } If the test_expression returns FALSE, the codes will continue to next line. x &lt;- 5 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } else { print(&#39;x is not larger than 3&#39;) } ## [1] &quot;x is larger than 3&quot; x &lt;- 1 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } Some other conditional statements include switch, which, etc. 3.5 Loops Loops help us repeat the codes we want to run in more than one times. for loop is the intuitive and commonly-used one. for (range){ statement } range will provide the range for a variable. for (i in 1:3){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 3.6 Functions Functions are codes have been defined with specific usage. You only need to input some necessary variables and functions will do the tasks and return the result. For example, sum() function could help you add the all the numbers in a vector or dataframe and return the sum. sum(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 20 Another example is mean() function could help you average the numbers in a vector or data frame and return the mean value. mean(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 5 It is important to use the right function to do the right task. To do this, you have to be familiar with the functions you are using. It needs more practice. References "],

System tool Besides importing data by codes, you could also import data with the system tool. If this is your first time to use this tool, there may be a process to install the packages depending your options. But don’t worry, RStudio can do it by itself. You just need to click the button to approve the installation. File -&gt; Import dataset -&gt; choose the type of dataset you want to import There are some other options or parameters you could set in the import functions listed above (e.g., specify a variable type or try to skip some of the rows). Sometimes it is sort of complex to do it. So for me, I just do those things after I import the dataset. 4.1.2 Save file CSV file write.csv(df, # data &#39;c:/filename.csv&#39;) # file location and name EXCEL file library(xlsx) write.xlsx(mydata, # data &quot;c:/mydata.xlsx&quot;) # file location and name dta STATA file library(foreign) write.dta(mydata, &quot;c:/mydata.dta&quot;) Usually, it takes less time to save file in CSV and CSV file has a smaller size in storage. 4.1.3 File location As you can see in the examples, you need to specify the location (or path) of the file to make sure that R could find your file in the right position. Usually you could find it by checking the system property of the file. You could aovid this. First put your R file and dataset in the same folder. Then start the R file by double clicking. R will use the folder where the R file locates as the working folder. Then you could only specify the name of the file. This is recommended. Since it will easier for others to check your codes since they do not need to change the path of the file. 4.2 View data You could view the variable names and simple discription in the Environment pane on the right-top position of RStudio. If you want to view more information, clik the variable name and view the variale in new window. Here, we use the built-in dataset mtcars as a example.

It applies the operations in two columns or the function in one column directly rather than applies them on each element one by one.

We will mainly go through its main functions (BiomedicalDataScience 2019; r-project 2019). 5.1 select() Before the lecture, install the package in your machine. install.packages(&#39;dplyr&#39;) Let’s first import the package and the mtcars dataset. library(dplyr) data(mtcars) If we want to select some columns from the dataset. We could use the select() function in dplyr. It is similar to the subset() function, but here, you do not need to use select = c('mpg', 'disp'). You use the names of the columns directly in the function. df &lt;- select(mtcars, # name of the data frame mpg, disp) # column names you want to select head(df, 3) ## mpg disp ## Mazda RX4 21.0 160 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 160 ## Datsun 710 22.8 108 You could also use the index of the columns. df &lt;- select(mtcars, # name of the data frame c(1, 3)) # index of the columns you want to select head(df, 3) ## mpg disp ## Mazda RX4 21.0 160 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 160 ## Datsun 710 22.8 108 The codes above is kind of a traditional way to do the work. We start with a function and put parameters in the function. However, this is not the typical way to use dplyr. The codes below is a more dplyr way people use dplyr. We start with the name of the data frame. Then, we put a speical sign %&gt;% called pipe after it. We continue from a new line and write the function we want to use. Besides that, we could add more functions with the pipe operator.

["data-visualization-with-base-functions.html", "Chapter 6 Data Visualization with Base Functions 6.1 Scatter plot 6.2 Line plot 6.3 Bar plot 6.4 Add more elements in the plots 6.5 Pie chart 6.6 Boxplot 6.7 Color in R", " Chapter 6 Data Visualization with Base Functions We go through the base plotting functions in R in this chapter. 6.1 Scatter plot Scatter plot is a good way to show the distribution of data points. data(mtcars) plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt) # with first as x, and second as y Or, you could use the variable names directly and indicate the dataset as the codes below. You will get the same result. plot(wt ~ mpg, data = mtcars) # you have to specify the name of the data frame here 6.2 Line plot You could transfer the scatter plot above to a line plot by just adding a type variable to indicate that you are plotting a line. Line plot is good for presenting the trend of a variable changing by time. year &lt;- c(1998:2003) # create variable year sales &lt;- c(500, 600, 650, 700, 400, 550) # create variable sales df &lt;- data.frame(year, sales) # combine the variables into one data frame called df plot(sales ~ year, data = df, type = &#39;l&#39;) # type indicates the line type with l You could also choose another type by changing the value of type, as the one below. plot(sales ~ year, data = df, type = &#39;b&#39;) # b for both line and pint You could use help(plot) to check more styles of the plots. 6.3 Bar plot Bar plot is a good way to compare the values in each year or for each item. You could use barplot() to draw it. barplot(df$sales, names.arg = df$year) # names.org indicates the vector of names to be plotted under each bar 6.4 Add more elements in the plots For a reader-friendly plots, you have to add more information such as titile, labels, and legend. For the plot above, we could use the codes below to make it more informative. barplot(df$sales, names.arg = df$year, main = &#39;Bar plot of the sales for each year from 1998 to 2003&#39;, # add title for the plot xlab = &#39;Year&#39;, # add label tag for the x-axis ylab = &#39;Sales (million dollors)&#39;, # add label for the y-axis ylim = c(0, 1000), # set the range of y axis, you could set the range of x axis with xlim legend = &#39;Sales&#39;) # add lengend name 6.5 Pie chart Pie chart is a good way to show the share of each part. You could use pie() function to draw a pie chart in R. pie(df$sales, # value for each piece labels = df$year, # label for each piece main=&quot;Pie Chart of the Sales in ecah Year&quot;) 6.6 Boxplot Boxplot is also called box-whisker plot. It is to present the distribution of the dataset based on their quartiles. In R, you could use boxplot() to draw a boxplot. t &lt;- c(1, 5, 10, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19) boxplot(t, range = 0) # set range = 0 makes the whiskers reach the samllest and largest values in the dataset t &lt;- c(1, 5, 10, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19) boxplot(t, range = 1) # set range = 1 makes the the whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which is no more than range times the interquartile range from the box 6.7 Color in R You could change the color of the plots by adding col = in the functions. For example. plot(sales ~ year, data = df, type = &#39;b&#39;, col = &#39;YellowGreen&#39;) # specify the name of the color Here is a link where you could find the name of the color. You could also use the hexadecimal color code to indicate the color. For example. barplot(df$sales, names.arg = df$year, main = &#39;Bar plot of the sales for each year from 1998 to 2003&#39;, xlab = &#39;Year&#39;, ylab = &#39;Sales (million dollors)&#39;, legend = &#39;Sales&#39;, col = &#39;#009999&#39;) # use the hexadecimal color code, you need to start it with the hash tag By the same link, you could also find the hexadcimal code for each color.

Before the lecture, please install the package first. install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) 7.1 Grammer of Graphics (gg) We have grammar for languages. We also have grammar for graphcis. That’s where gg of ggplot2 comes from. For ggplot2, it has seven grammatical elements listed in the table below (DataCamp 2019). Element Description Data The dataset being plotted. Aesthetics The scales onto which we map our data. Geometries The visual elements used for our data. Facets Plotting small multiples. Statistics Representations of our data to aid understanding. Coordinates The space on which the data will be plotted. Themes All non-data ink. Let’s take the codes below as a simple example to show how those different elements work in ggplots. From this example, we might have a general idea what is each element and how does it work. We will talk about each element in details later. library(ggplot2) data(mtcars) ggplot(mtcars, # Data aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + # Aesthetics geom_point() + # Geometries facet_grid(. ~ gear) + # Facets stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, col = &quot;blue&quot;) + # Statistics scale_x_continuous(&#39;Miles/(US) gallon&#39;, limits = c(0, 40)) + scale_y_continuous(&#39;Weight (1000 lbs)&#39;, limits = c(0, 7)) + # Coordinates theme_bw() # Themes 7.2 Data, Aesthetics, and Geometries Generally, if you want to draw figures with ggplot2, you need at least three elements, which are data, aesthetics, and geometries. Data is the dataset we want to visualize. Aesthetic specifies the variables and related attributes. Geometry indicates the plot type and related attributes. Take the example above again. We want to visualize the varialbes of mpg and wp (aesthetic) of the dataset mtcars (data) with a scatter plot (geometry). Similar to dplyr, ggplot2 also has its own fashion of coding. We start with the ggplot() function. Please pay attention that there is no 2 in the name of the function. In the function, we first indicate the name of the dataset or data frame. Then we use aes() to indicate the scales we want to map our data. Here, we map mpg to x axis, and wt to y axis. Then we use a plus sign + to connect it to other functions. We are going to draw a scatter plot, so we use geom_point(). ggplot(mtcars, # Data aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + # Aesthetics geom_point() # Geometries We could see the result and it is following our codes. Based on this plot, we have a overall idea of the relationship between wt and mpg, which is wt has a negative relationship with mpg. This result makes sense to us. If a car is lighter and it could drive farther with the same amount of gasoline. (Please remember that this relationship is just a type of correlation, not causality.) We could add more attributes in the aesthetic element. For example, we could use color to indicate the value of hp by adding col = hp. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt, col = hp)) + geom_point() Now we have more information in the result. While the weight is heavier, the hourse power is stronger. Here, hp is a continous variable, so ggplot2 uses the darkness of the color to indicate the value. However, if we use a categorical varibable or a factor (e.g. binomial variable), ggplot2 will use different colors to show different types. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt, col = factor(am))) + geom_point() Here, am stands for the types of transmission system (0 = automatic, 1 = manual). We use factor() to transfer this variable to a categorical one. ggplot2 uses one color for automatic transmission and another color for mannual transmission. Besides color, there are several other parameters to show different aesthetics of the plots. There are differences between the usages of continuous variable and categorical variable. If you want to map variables in those aesthetics, you have to do it in the aes() function. Parameter Description Continuous variable Categorical variable x X axis position ✓ y y axis position ✓ size Diameter of points, thickness of lines ✓ alpha Transparency ✓ ✓ color Color of dots, outlines of other shapes ✓ ✓ fill Fill colour ✓ ✓ labels Text on a plot or axes ✓ shape Shape of point ✓ linetype Line dash pattern ✓ As for geometries, there are many different types you can use for different plots. For examples, geom_point() for scatter plot, geom_bar for bar plot, geom_boxplot for boxplot, etc. Most functions of geometries are self-explained, so you could tell what their usages easily. We all talk about those commonly used geometries such as sactter plot, bar plot, line plot, etc. in the following parts. 7.2.1 Scatter plot We use geom_point() to plot scatter plot in R with ggplot2. In the example below, we map mpg to x axis, and wt to y axis. We indicate the transparency by set alpha = hp. The transparency of each point is decided by its value of hp. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt, alpha = hp)) + geom_point() 7.2.2 Bar plot In the example below, we draw a bar plot to show the number of cars with different tansmission systems. In aes(), we only indicate the variable am. R then will count the number for each transimission type. We use geom_bar() to plot it. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = am)) + geom_bar() Go back to our previous example, which is different from the example above. year &lt;- c(1998:2003) # create variable year sales &lt;- c(500, 600, 650, 700, 400, 550) # create variable sales df &lt;- data.frame(year, sales) # combine the variables into one data frame called df ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = sales)) + geom_bar(stat = &#39;identity&#39;) # you need to specify stat = &#39;identity&#39; to plot the actual value for each year, not count Or you could use another geometry called geom_col() to do it easily. ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = sales)) + geom_col() 7.2.3 Line plot To show the usage of line plot in ggplot2, we use a new dataset economics from the ggplot2 package. This dataset is produced from US economic time series data. Use help() to check more information of this dataset. In this example, we use geom_line() to draw a line plot. data(economics) ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) + geom_line(col = &#39;Blue&#39;) # indicate the color of the line by setting col = &#39;Blue&#39; In this plot, it shows clearly the temporal trend of the number of unemployed population in the US. There two increase recently starting from 2001 and 2008, which match two economic risks in around 2001 and 2008. 7.2.4 Boxplot In the example below, we draw a boxplot for each transmission type. To do this, we map am to the x axis, and mpg to the y axis. We use as.factor() to transfer am to a factor (categorical variable). ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = as.factor(am), y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot() 7.2.5 Pie chart In ggplot2, it is not as intuitive as the base function pie() to draw a pie chart. That’s use the same example to see the difference. year &lt;- c(1998:2003) # create variable year sales &lt;- c(500, 600, 650, 700, 400, 550) # create variable sales df &lt;- data.frame(year, sales) # combine the variables into one data frame called df ggplot(df, aes(x = &#39;&#39;, y = sales, fill = factor(year))) + geom_bar(width = 1, stat = &#39;identity&#39;) + coord_polar(&#39;y&#39;) Whatggplot2 does here to draw a bar plot is to create a bar plot first. ggplot(df, aes(x = &#39;&#39;, y = sales, fill = factor(year))) + geom_bar(width = 1, stat = &#39;identity&#39;) And then transfer the coordinate system to the polar one. ggplot(df, aes(x = &#39;&#39;, y = sales, fill = factor(year))) + geom_bar(width = 1, stat = &#39;identity&#39;) + coord_polar(&#39;y&#39;) 7.3 Facets If you want to split up your data by one or more variables and plot each subset in one figure, facet is the element you want to use. In the following example, we draw a scatter plot for each number of forward gears. In each plot, we map mpg to the x axis and wt to y axis. The three plots are aligned in a row. p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, # store the plot result in variable p aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) geom_point() ## geom_point: na.rm = FALSE ## stat_identity: na.rm = FALSE ## position_identity p + facet_grid(. ~ gear) # Facets, for each number of foward gears If we want to align the plots in a column, exchange the position of the varialbe in the function. p + facet_grid(gear ~ .) # Facets, pay attention to the position of gear and the dot sign We could put more variables to split the plots. In the following example, we put one more variable vs in the facet_grid(). p + facet_grid(vs ~ gear) # add vs We could use the margins = T to add more plots showing the aggregation of the plots in each column or row. p + facet_grid(vs ~ gear, margins = T) # add aggregation plots for each row and column We could use labeller = label_both to add more information in the label. p + facet_grid(vs ~ gear, labeller = label_both) # add more info in the label 7.4 Statistics You could fit a line to see the general trend of the scatter plot by adding stat_smooth(). p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + geom_point() p + stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) # linear line p + stat_smooth(method = &#39;loess&#39;) # non-linear line You could use also use draw a histogram for the dataset. p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg)) p + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) # the width of each category is 5 p + geom_histogram(bins = 3) # the number of bins is 3 You could fit a denisty line for the histogram. p + geom_histogram(aes( y = ..density..), binwidth = 3, col = &#39;Black&#39;, fill = &#39;White&#39;) + # use density instead of count geom_density(alpha=.2, fill=&quot;Gray&quot;) Another way to show more statistics about your data is boxplot, which we have been introduced before. p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(gear), y = mpg)) p + geom_boxplot() 7.5 Coordinates While there are many coordinate systems supported by ggplot2, the most commonly used is Cartesian coordinate system, which is the combination of x axis and y axis orthogonally. 7.5.1 Zooming in and out In the following example, we zoom in our plot to a specific area. p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + geom_point() p + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(10, 30), ylim = c(2,4)) 7.5.2 Ratio We could change the ratio of the length of a y unit relative to the length of a x unit (\\(\\frac{\\text{y unit}}{\\text{x unit}}\\)). p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, # Data aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + # Aesthetics geom_point() p + coord_fixed(ratio = 1) # 1 means x and y axes have the same unit p + coord_fixed(ratio = 5) 7.5.3 Swaping the axes p + coord_flip() ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = as.factor(am), y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() ggplot(mtcars, # Data aes(gear)) + # Aesthetics geom_bar() + scale_y_reverse() 7.5.4 Polar coordinate system We touched the polar coordinate system a little bit when drawing a pie chart. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = &#39;&#39;, fill = factor(gear))) + geom_bar(width = 1) + coord_polar(theta = &#39;y&#39;) We could do this in a different way. ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(gear))) + geom_bar(width = 1, col = &#39;Black&#39;, fill = &#39;Grey&#39;) + coord_polar() 7.6 Themes ggplot2 is powerful in its flexibility of themes. 7.6.1 Add labels Add labels with labs() function. p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + geom_point() p + labs(title = &#39;Plot 1&#39;, # title of the plot subtitle = &#39;Subplot1&#39;, # sub title x = &#39;Miles/(US) gallon&#39;, # x label y = &#39;Weight (1000 lbs)&#39;) # y label Or use ggtitle(), xlab(), and ylab() instead. p + ggtitle(&#39;Plot1&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Miles/(US) gallon&#39;) + # x label ylab(&#39;Weight (1000 lbs)&#39;) # y label 7.6.2 Change ticks Here is an example of changing the ticks for a discrete variable. p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(am), y = mpg)) p + geom_boxplot() + scale_x_discrete(name = &quot;Transmission&quot;, # name of the x axis labels = c(&#39;Automatic&#39;, &#39;Manual&#39;)) # change 0 and 1 to automatic and manaual 7.6.3 theme() function theme() function could help to change the styles of every components of the plots. Here are a few examples about it (ggplot2 2019). p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &#39;Fuel economy declines as weight increases&#39;) p # original plot We could use plot.title to change the style of a title in the plot. In the following exmaple, we change the font size of the title by setting element_text() and making size to be larger as the defual one. p + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(2))) We could also use absolute value to indicate the size directly. p + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15)) We could change the background of the plot by setting the value of plot.background in the theme() function. For example, if we want to change the color, we could set element_rect() and fill = 'red'. p + theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = &#39;red&#39;)) More specifically, if we want to change the style of the panel, which is the inner part restricted by x and y axes, we could set the value of panel.background. p + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &#39;green&#39;, colour = &#39;red&#39;)) We could set the line type of the panel’s border. p + theme(panel.border = element_rect(linetype = &#39;dashed&#39;, fill = NA)) Change the attributes of the lines for the grid. element_line() stands for the attributes of the lines. p + theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = &quot;black&quot;), panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = &#39;blue&#39;)) Use element_blank() to remove the themes of the target. p + theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) We could put the gridline on the top of our data by setting panel.ontop = TRUE. p + theme( panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA), panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = &#39;Blue&#39;), panel.ontop = TRUE ) Change the line style of the axis. p + theme( axis.line = element_line(size = 3, colour = &#39;red&#39;) ) Change the text style of the axis. p + theme( axis.text = element_text(colour = &#39;Green&#39;, size = 15) ) Change the attributes of the text for the axis ticks. p + theme( axis.ticks = element_line(size = 1.5) ) And y label. p + theme( axis.title.y = element_text(size = rel(1.5), angle = 30) ) Now, let’s see what we could do for the legend. p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl), shape = factor(vs))) + labs( x = &#39;Weight (1000 lbs)&#39;, y = &#39;Fuel economy (mpg)&#39;, colour = &#39;Cylinders&#39;, shape = &#39;Transmission system&#39; ) p Remove the legend by setting its postion as legend.position = 'none'. p + theme( legend.position = &#39;none&#39; ) p + theme( legend.position = &#39;top&#39; ) By setting legend.justification for the legend, we anchor point for positioning legend inside plot (“center” or two-element numeric vector) or the justification according to the plot area when positioned outside the plot p + theme( legend.justification = &#39;top&#39; ) p + theme( legend.position = c(.95, .95), legend.justification = c(&#39;right&#39;, &#39;top&#39;), legend.box.just = &#39;right&#39; ) p + theme( legend.box.background = element_rect(), legend.box.margin = margin(6, 6, 6, 6) ) Set attributes for the key of the legend. p + theme( legend.key = element_rect(fill = &#39;white&#39;, colour = &#39;black&#39;) ) Set attributes for the text of the legend. p + theme( legend.text = element_text(size = 8, colour = &#39;red&#39;, face = &#39;bold&#39;) ) References "],
["exploratory-data-analysis.html", "Chapter 8 Exploratory Data Analysis 8.1 Introduction the dataset and research question 8.2 Data munipulation 8.3 Data visualization 8.4 Combine them togethor 8.5 More examples 8.6 More more example", " Chapter 8 Exploratory Data Analysis We are going to use what we have learnt so far to do some exploratory data analysis, which is also the practice for data manipulation and visualization. 8.1 Introduction the dataset and research question The dataset we used here is from the General Social Survey (GSS) from the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago. The dataset shows the results of the vocabulary tests for several years. It contains eight variables (Arel-Bundock 2019). The descriptions are listed below. Variable Descriptions year The test year gender Gender nativeBorn Was the respondent born in the US? ageGroup Grouped age of the respondent educGroup Grouped education level of the respondent vocab Number of words out of 10 correct on a vocabulary test age Age of the respondent in years educ Years of education of the respondent Our research question is how do the average vocabulary test results change over time? Let’s get start. We first library the packages we need for this task. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(readr) 8.2 Data munipulation We could the import tool to import our dataset and copy the code. GSSvocab &lt;- read_csv(&quot;GSSvocab.csv&quot;) ## Warning: Missing column names filled in: &#39;X1&#39; [1] ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## X1 = col_double(), ## year = col_double(), ## gender = col_character(), ## nativeBorn = col_character(), ## ageGroup = col_character(), ## educGroup = col_character(), ## vocab = col_double(), ## age = col_double(), ## educ = col_double() ## ) There are some warning messages when we import the dataset. The reason for this warning message is that we did not specify the type of the variables. Therefore, R tries to give every variable a type based on its own understanding of the data. Let’s check the dataset to see what it looks like. head(GSSvocab, 5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 9 ## X1 year gender nativeBorn ageGroup educGroup vocab age educ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1978. 1978 female yes 50-59 12 yrs 10 52 12 ## 2 1978. 1978 female yes 60+ &lt;12 yrs 6 74 9 ## 3 1978. 1978 male yes 30-39 &lt;12 yrs 4 35 10 ## 4 1978. 1978 female yes 50-59 12 yrs 9 50 12 ## 5 1978. 1978 female yes 40-49 12 yrs 6 41 12 Except the first variable, all other variables seem to be imported in the right type. Since the first variable is not useful for our data analysis, we do not need to care about it. Then, based on the initial research questions, we need to calculate the average vocabulary test results for each year. We apply the group_by() function here. year_vocab &lt;- GSSvocab %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(avgVocab = mean(vocab, na.rm = T)) # indicate na.rm = T to deal with missing value head(year_vocab, 5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## year avgVocab ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1978 5.96 ## 2 1982 5.74 ## 3 1984 6.02 ## 4 1987 5.74 ## 5 1988 5.82 8.3 Data visualization Then, we apply ggplot() to visualize the dataset year_vocab we have just generated. ggplot(year_vocab, aes(x = year, y = avgVocab)) + geom_line() For a complete plot, we have add more infomation such as title, x label, and y label, etc. ggplot(year_vocab, aes(x = year, y = avgVocab)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &#39;Average vocabulary test result for each year&#39;, y = &#39;Average vocabulary test score&#39;, x = &#39;Year&#39;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20), axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = &#39;black&#39;), axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) 8.4 Combine them togethor We could put those codes together. GSSvocab %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(avgVocab = mean(vocab, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avgVocab)) + # we do not put name of the dataset here geom_line() + labs(title = &#39;Average vocabulary test result for each year&#39;, y = &#39;Average vocabulary test score&#39;, x = &#39;Year&#39;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20), axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = &#39;black&#39;), axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) 8.5 More examples Let’s make the research more challenging. Let’s study the topic that how do the average vocabulary test results for male and female change over time? year_gender_vocab &lt;- GSSvocab %&gt;% group_by(year, gender) %&gt;% summarize(avgVocab = mean(vocab, na.rm = T)) head(year_gender_vocab, 5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## # Groups: year [3] ## year gender avgVocab ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1978 female 6.02 ## 2 1978 male 5.89 ## 3 1982 female 5.76 ## 4 1982 male 5.71 ## 5 1984 female 6.07 ggplot(year_gender_vocab, aes(x = year, y = avgVocab, col = gender)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &#39;Average vocabulary test result for male and female in each year&#39;, y = &#39;Average vocabulary test score&#39;, x = &#39;Year&#39;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15), axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = &#39;black&#39;), axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) Again, we could put them together. GSSvocab %&gt;% group_by(year, gender) %&gt;% summarize(avgVocab = mean(vocab, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avgVocab, col = gender)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &#39;Average vocabulary test result for male and female in each year&#39;, y = &#39;Average vocabulary test score&#39;, x = &#39;Year&#39;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15), axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = &#39;black&#39;), axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) 8.6 More more example We could also do the same thing to each age group and even plot them in different plots with facet_wrap() function. GSSvocab %&gt;% group_by(year, ageGroup) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(ageGroup)) %&gt;% # delete the the obs with missing values in ageGroup summarize(avgVocab = mean(vocab, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avgVocab)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ageGroup, labeller = label_both) + labs(title = &#39;Average vocabulary test result for different age group in each year&#39;, y = &#39;Average vocabulary test score&#39;, x = &#39;Year&#39;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15), axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = &#39;black&#39;), axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) Well, some plots even do not need you to manipulate the data. You could draw the plot directly. ggplot(GSSvocab, aes(x = ageGroup, y = vocab)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~year) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) ## Warning: Removed 1348 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).

I covered several points in class simply which I think is not enough. I think this question is more related to the comparison between R and Stata. I read several articles (Thompson 2019; Bailey 2019) online and list some key points in the table below. I hope this will give a better understanding of both R and Stata. Advantages of R (More Flexible but less Formal) Free and Open source More advanced technique packages Deal with more than one datasets (big data) at the same time Deal with not only data analysis tasks Advantages of Stata (More Formal but less Flexible) More algorithms, packages, and implementations of econometircs Faster It is supported by Statacorp so the result is reliable It presents results in a clear format Syntax is simple and standard for most data analysis Help document is formal Besides those advantages, they have a lot of overlaps with each other. People cannot say one is absolutely better than the other. People choose them based on their task requirements. Sometimes, people install both of them in their computers (e.g. my laptop has both of them). References "],
