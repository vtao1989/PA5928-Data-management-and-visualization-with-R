You can also use it to create website (like this course website), write papers, analyze texts, etc. The most important thing is that R is free and easy to use, that’s why it has been applied in many fileds. 2.2 What is RStudio RStudio is a programming software for editing and running R code. It has many great features to make R programming easier! 2.3 Install R + RStudio For better coding and running R, you should install both R and RStudio. You could code R with the installation of R only, however, RStudio provides you with more conveinece in coding. In this course, we will use RStudio to do all the course lectures and exercises. So please make sure you install both of them! R could be downloaded here and RStudio could be downloaded here. Both Windows OS (Operating System) and Mac OS are supported, so please choose the right one you need for your own system. (If you have any questions about the installation of R or RStudio, please come to me in the office hours or ask IT for help) Or you could use the computers in the lab when there is no lecture. 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of RStudio Below is a screenshot of the user interface of RStudio. You will find couple of panes/windows with different usages.(Selvam 2019) Menu/Tool Bar Source The pane where you write and edit your codes. Environment/History Environment lists all the variables that you are currently using. History presents the codes you have runned before. Console Console is the original R interactive window. You could run codes and see the results here. Plot/Help Plot window shows the output figures. Help window presents the information of the function or package you are checking. 2.5 Create and save R file Three ways to create a R file in the RStudio: 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N 3. Tool Bar -&gt; New file button Also three ways to save R file 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; Save 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + S 3. Tool Bar -&gt; Save file button 2.6 Print Hello, world Now, let’s try to code something and run them! Let’s print the very classic “Hello, world!” with print() function. We could run the codes in several ways: Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and click the Run button located in the right-top position of the source pane. Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and use shortcut: Ctrl + Enter You could also click the Re-run button near the Run button to re-run the codes you ran last time. print(&#39;Hello, world!&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Because what we need to output here is a string varible, we have to put them in the quotation mark. Either single quotation or double quotation mark works well. Let’s see another example. print(5928) ## [1] 5928 Here, 5928 is an integer and we do not need to put them in the quotation marks. 2.7 Install and use R Packages R is easy to use because it has many packages with different usages. These packages could help you accomplish some complex tasks with just several lines of codes. Some packages have been already been installed and you could use them directly, which are base packages. However, most of the packages have to be installed before you use them. There are couple of ways you could install a package. Let’s take the gbm package for example. 1. Manu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Install Packages... -&gt; Input the package name -&gt; Click Install button 2. Use the code below: install.packages(&quot;gbm&quot;) After the installation of the package, you have import it with library() function before you use the related functions. library(gbm) ## Loaded gbm 2.1.5 We will spend more time in future classes to explore the various R packages and their different usages. 2.8 Make notes It is important to write notes for your codes. It could help others or even yourself understand your codes easily. Use hash tag to indicate the notes. For example, gbm1 &lt;- gbm(AvgMet~PkAreaH+StpNumH+DisToMin, # formula data=MetM, # dataset var.monotone=c(+1, rep(0,10),rep(0,15)), distribution=&quot;gaussian&quot;, # see the help for other choices n.trees=5000, # number of trees shrinkage=0.001, # shrinkage or learning rate, 0.001 to 0.1 usually work interaction.depth=6, # 1: additive model, 2: two-way interactions, etc. bag.fraction = 0.5, # subsampling fraction, 0.5 is probably best n.minobsinnode = 10, # minimum total weight needed in each node cv.folds = 5) R will not run the codes after hash tags in each line. Please try to write simple but necessary notes for the codes. Keep this as a good habbit and you will thank yourself in the future. 2.9 Tips You could divide your codes into sections by enterting chunks before each sections with the shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + R. This will help you organize your codes. Use ? or help() function to find the related instruction or help page, for example, if you want to find the instruction of library() function, just code ?library or help(library) Both will direct you to the instruction page you are looking for in the help window.

["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction to R 3.1 Variable types 3.2 Operations 3.3 Data structures 3.4 Conditional statements 3.5 Loops 3.6 Functions", " Chapter 3 Introduction to R A variable is used to store data including value, vector, data frame, etc, which R could use to manipulate (tutorialspoint 2019b). This chapter introduces variable types, operations between variables, data structures, conditional statements, loops, and functions. Before we start, let’s first see how to name a variable. The valid variable name could be constructed with letters, numbers, the dot character (.), and underline character (_). Besides that, a valid variable name should start with a letter or the dot charater not followed by a number. Examples Validity Discussion var.name ✓ var_name ✓ _var_name ☓ Cannot start with the underline .var_name ✓ var%name ☓ Cannot contain % .2var_name ☓ Cannot use the dot followed by a number to start with a variable name 2var_name ☓ Cannot start with a number 3.1 Variable types There are several types of variables which R could recognise, including character, numeric, integer, logical, and complex (Blischak et al. 2019). The type of one variable is decided by the type of value it stores. We can use class() function to check the type of each variable. Character (also known as strings) v &lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; class(v) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Numeric (real or decimal number/integer) v &lt;- 59.28 class(v) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Integer (L tells R that this number is an integer) v &lt;- 2L class(v) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; v &lt;-2 class(v) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Logical (Usually True or false) v &lt;- TRUE class(v) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; v &lt;- FALSE class(v) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Complex (complex number is another type of number, different with real number) v &lt;- 1 + 4i class(v) ## [1] &quot;complex&quot; It is important to know clearly what is the type of the variable you are using since different types of variables may have different methods to deal with. Another caveat is that the outlook of the variable may not show its real variable type. For example, a common situation is that a variable contains numbers could be characters. v &lt;- &quot;59.28&quot; class(v) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Here, the number has quotation marks outside, which means it has been transferred to type character. Therefore, please be careful about this! 3.2 Operations An operation tells R the mathematical or logical munipulations (tutorialspoint 2019a). 3.2.1 Assignment operations Assignment operators assign values to variables. Left assignment a &lt;- 1 b &lt;&lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; c = c(1, 3, 4) Right assignment 1 -&gt; a 2 -&gt;&gt; b 3.2.2 Arithmetic operations Add 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 Subtract 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Multiple 3 * 5 ## [1] 15 Divide 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Power 5 ^ 2 ## [1] 25 5 ** 2 # you can also do like this ## [1] 25 Mode (find the remainder) 5 %% 2 ## [1] 1 3.2.3 Relational operations The relational operators compare the two elements and return a logical value (TRUE or FALSE) Larger 3 &gt; 4 ## [1] FALSE 5 &gt; 3 ## [1] TRUE Smaller 3 &lt; 5 ## [1] TRUE 4 &lt; 2 ## [1] FALSE Equal 4 == 4 ## [1] TRUE 5 == 4 ## [1] FALSE No less than (larger or equal to) 3 &gt;= 4 ## [1] FALSE 3 &gt;= 2 ## [1] TRUE No larger than (samller or equal to) 5 &lt;= 2 ## [1] FALSE 5 &lt;= 5 ## [1] TRUE Not equal 3 != 4 ## [1] TRUE 3 != 3 ## [1] FALSE 3.2.4 Logical operations Logical operators are operations only for logical, numeric, or complex types. Most of the time, we apply them on logical values or variables. For numeric variables, 0 is considered FALSE and non-zero numbers are taken as TRUE (DataMentor 2019). You could use T for TRUE or F for FALSE as abbreviation. Logical And TRUE &amp; TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE &amp; TRUE ## [1] FALSE FALSE &amp; FALSE ## [1] FALSE Logical Or TRUE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | FALSE ## [1] FALSE Logical Not ! TRUE ## [1] FALSE ! FALSE ## [1] TRUE 3.3 Data structures Variables and values could construct different data structures including vector, matrix, data frame, list, and factor (Kabacoff 2019). Vetor You could create a vetor with c() function. a &lt;- c(5, 9, 2, 8) # create a numeric vector a # show the value of this vetor ## [1] 5 9 2 8 b &lt;- c(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;, &#39;!&#39;) # character vector b ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c &lt;- c(5, &#39;good&#39;) # if you create a vector containing mixed variable types, such as numeric and character, R will restrict them to be the same variable type, here, character c ## [1] &quot;5&quot; &quot;good&quot; You could select elements in the vetor by using var_name[#]. Please pay attention on how R indexes its elements in the data structure. a[3] # select the 3rd element ## [1] 2 b[1:3] # select from the 1st to the 3rd element ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c[1] # select the 2nd element ## [1] &quot;5&quot; 1:3 means from 1 to 3, so it actually stands for three numbers here, which are 1, 2, 3. Matrix You could create a matrix using matrix() function. a &lt;- matrix(1:6, # the data to be put in the matrix, here we use numbers from 1 to 6 nrow = 2, # number of rows in the matrix ncol = 3, # number of columns in the matrix byrow = FALSE) # how to put the data in the matrix, FALSE means by columns, TURE means by rows. a ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 For variable selection, the intuitive way is using coordinates. a[2,3] # select the elements in the 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 6 You could also select the entire row or column. a[ ,2] # the 2nd column ## [1] 3 4 a[1, ] # the 1st row ## [1] 1 3 5 Data frame Data frame is a frequently-used data type in R. It could include columns with different types of values stored in them. Let’s create a dataframe with mixed variables types using data.frame() function. ID &lt;- c(1:4) # create variable ID Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;) # create variable Name Score &lt;- c(69.5, 77.5, 81.5, 90) # create variable Score df &lt;- data.frame(ID, Name, Score) # combine the varibles into one data frame called df df ## ID Name Score ## 1 1 A 69.5 ## 2 2 B 77.5 ## 3 3 C 81.5 ## 4 4 D 90.0 We created a data frame stored the students’ ID, name, and their test scores. If we want to select elements from this data frame, there are couple of ways. df[2,3] # 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 77.5 df[&#39;ID&#39;] # column of variable ID ## ID ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 df[c(&#39;ID&#39;, &#39;Score&#39;)] # column of ID and Score ## ID Score ## 1 1 69.5 ## 2 2 77.5 ## 3 3 81.5 ## 4 4 90.0 There is another way to select the column by its name. When you type $ after the name of the data frame, RStudio will list all the variable names in that data frame which makes it easier to choose the variable you want. It is more commonly used. df$Name # column of variable Name ## [1] A B C D ## Levels: A B C D List A list could store mixed types of values, which is different from vetor. a &lt;- list(ID = c(1, 2), Name = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), Score = c(69.5, 89)) When you want to select elements from a list, you could do it in a similar way as a vector. However, list does not define row or column, so you cannot use 2-D coordinates to select elements like a data frame. a[1] ## $ID ## [1] 1 2 a[2:3] ## $Name ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## ## $Score ## [1] 69.5 89.0 Someone might be confusing since list looks silimar to data frame. Here is a good discussion about it. Due to the time limitation, we will not cover this discussion in class. The main idea is that list is more flexible than data frame, while data frame has more restrictions. However, since data frame is more similar to 2-D table structure which is more frequently used in our daily work. We apply data frame more than list. Factor Factor is the nominal variable in R. This type will be very useful when we want to analyze data from different groups, such as gender, school, etc. a &lt;- c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1) class(a) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; afactor &lt;- factor(a) class(afactor) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; 3.4 Conditional statements if (test_expression){ statement_1 } else { statement_2 } If the test_expression returns TRUE, then the codes will go to statement_1, if it returns FALSE, the codes will go to statement_2. You could also omit the else part. if (test_expression){ statement_1 } If the test_expression returns FALSE, the codes will continue to next line. x &lt;- 5 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } else { print(&#39;x is not larger than 3&#39;) } ## [1] &quot;x is larger than 3&quot; x &lt;- 1 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } Some other conditional statements include switch, which, etc. 3.5 Loops Loops help us repeat the codes we want to run in more than one times. for loop is the intuitive and commonly-used one. for (range){ statement } range will provide the range for a variable. for (i in 1:3){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 3.6 Functions Functions are codes have been defined with specific usage. You only need to input some necessary variables and functions will do the tasks and return the result. For example, sum() function could help you add the all the numbers in a vector or dataframe and return the sum. sum(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 20 Another example is mean() function could help you average the numbers in a vector or data frame and return the mean value. mean(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 5 It is important to use the right function to do the right task. To do this, you have to be familiar with the functions you are using. It needs more practice. References "],

System tool Besides importing data by codes, you could also import data with the system tool. If this is your first time to use this tool, there may be a process to install the packages depending your options. But don’t worry, RStudio can do it by itself. You just need to click the button to approve the installation. File -&gt; Import dataset -&gt; choose the type of dataset you want to import There are some other options or parameters you could set in the import functions listed above (e.g., specify a variable type or try to skip some of the rows). Sometimes it is sort of complex to do it. So for me, I just do those things after I import the dataset. 4.1.2 Save file CSV file write.csv(df, # data &#39;c:/filename.csv&#39;) # file location and name EXCEL file library(xlsx) write.xlsx(mydata, # data &quot;c:/mydata.xlsx&quot;) # file location and name dta STATA file library(foreign) write.dta(mydata, &quot;c:/mydata.dta&quot;) Usually, it takes less time to save file in CSV and CSV file has a smaller size in storage. 4.1.3 File location As you can see in the examples, you need to specify the location (or path) of the file to make sure that R could find your file in the right position. Usually you could find it by checking the system property of the file. You could aovid this. First put your R file and dataset in the same folder. Then start the R file by double clicking. R will use the folder where the R file locates as the working folder. Then you could only specify the name of the file. This is recommended. Since it will easier for others to check your codes since they do not need to change the path of the file. 4.2 View data You could view the variable names and simple discription in the Environment pane on the right-top position of RStudio. If you want to view more information, clik the variable name and view the variale in new window. Here, we use the built-in dataset mtcars as a example.

Test the existence of missing values with is.na() function. We use an revised old example here. ID &lt;- c(1:4) # create variable ID Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, NA, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;) # create variable Name Score &lt;- c(69.5, 77.5, NA, 90) # create variable Score df &lt;- data.frame(ID, Name, Score) # combine the varibles into one data frame called df is.na(df) ## ID Name Score ## [1,] FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [2,] FALSE TRUE FALSE ## [3,] FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [4,] FALSE FALSE FALSE Assign missing values df$Score[df$Score == 90] &lt;- NA df ## ID Name Score ## 1 1 A 69.5 ## 2 2 &lt;NA&gt; 77.5 ## 3 3 C NA ## 4 4 D NA NAs will influence some functions. mean(df$Score) # get the mean value (does not ignore NA) ## [1] NA mean(df$Score, na.rm=TRUE) # (ignore NA) ## [1] 73.5 Test if the observations in the dataset has NAs. complete.cases(df) ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Find the observations with no NAs. na.omit(df) ## ID Name Score ## 1 1 A 69.5 4.6 Subset subset() is another way to select the data you want.

It links two datasets based on their common variable (the variable they both have). ID &lt;- c(1:4) # create variable ID Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;) # create variable Name Score1 &lt;- c(69.5, 77.5, 99, 90) # create variable Score1 df1 &lt;- data.frame(ID, Name, Score1) # combine the varibles into one data frame called df1 df1 ## ID Name Score1 ## 1 1 A 69.5 ## 2 2 B 77.5 ## 3 3 C 99.0 ## 4 4 D 90.0 Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;C&#39;) # create variable Name Score2 &lt;- c(98, 46, 55) # create variable Score2 df2 &lt;- data.frame(Name, Score2) # combine the varibles into one data frame called df2 df2 ## Name Score2 ## 1 A 98 ## 2 D 46 ## 3 C 55 merge(df1, df2, # dataframes needs to be merged by = &#39;Name&#39;, # name of the column/variable used for merging all.x = TRUE) # keep all observations in the first dataframe after merging ## Name ID Score1 Score2 ## 1 A 1 69.5 98 ## 2 B 2 77.5 NA ## 3 C 3 99.0 55 ## 4 D 4 90.0 46 merge(df1, df2, by = &#39;Name&#39;, all.y = TRUE) # keep all observations in the first dataframe after merging ## Name ID Score1 Score2 ## 1 A 1 69.5 98 ## 2 C 3 99.0 55 ## 3 D 4 90.0 46 You could keep all the observations in both two data frames by set all = TRUE in the function. 4.8 Column operation Column operation or vector operation is a very important idea in R. It applies the operations in two columns or the function in one column directly rather than applies them on each element one by one. ID &lt;- c(1:4) # create variable ID Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;) # create variable Name Score1 &lt;- c(69.5, 77.5, 99, 90) # create variable Score1 Score2 &lt;- c(98, 46, 55, 70) # create variable Score2 df &lt;- data.frame(ID, Name, Score1, Score2) # combine the varibles into one data frame called df df ## ID Name Score1 Score2 ## 1 1 A 69.5 98 ## 2 2 B 77.5 46 ## 3 3 C 99.0 55 ## 4 4 D 90.0 70 Create a new column in the dataframe to calculate the sum of score 1 and score 2 df$totalsocre &lt;- df$Score1 + df$Score2 df ## ID Name Score1 Score2 totalsocre ## 1 1 A 69.5 98 167.5 ## 2 2 B 77.5 46 123.5 ## 3 3 C 99.0 55 154.0 ## 4 4 D 90.0 70 160.0 Create a new column in the dataframe to calculate the mean of score 1 and score 2 df$meansocre &lt;- (df$Score1 + df$Score2)/2 df ## ID Name Score1 Score2 totalsocre meansocre ## 1 1 A 69.5 98 167.5 83.75 ## 2 2 B 77.5 46 123.5 61.75 ## 3 3 C 99.0 55 154.0 77.00 ## 4 4 D 90.0 70 160.0 80.00 References "],

Download the codes from Canvas and then start to do the exercises following the instruction in the codes. You do not need to write too-detailed notes, the focus is still coding. Do not write the codes related to the lecture in the exercise, which could help my grading easier. Make sure your codes satisfying the requirements of the exercise.

I covered several points in class simply which I think is not enough. I think this question is more related to the comparison between R and Stata. I read several articles (Thompson 2019; Bailey 2019) online and list some key points in the table below. I hope this will give a better understanding of both R and Stata. Advantages of R (More Flexible but less Formal) Free and Open source More advanced technique packages Deal with more than one datasets (big data) at the same time Deal with not only data analysis tasks Advantages of Stata (More Formal but less Flexible) More algorithms, packages, and implementations of econometircs Faster It is supported by Statacorp so the result is reliable It presents results in a clear format Syntax is simple and standard for most data analysis Help document is formal Besides those advantages, they have a lot of overlaps with each other. People cannot say one is absolutely better than the other. People choose them based on their task requirements. Sometimes, people install both of them in their computers (e.g. my laptop has both of them). References "],

In the final project, you will use the R programming skills you learn from this course and also the knowledge outside the course (other R techniques you are interested in or your professional knowledge in your study major) to solve a research question. The research question could be related your study field (e.g. public policy, urban and regional planning), or what you are interested, or your previous course or research project but you do it with R. You could use any packages in R to solve the problem. For example, you could use plots to do descriptive analysis. Or you could use regression to find more complicated correlation or causality results. 6.2 Timeline To accomplish the final project, you need to finish three tasks. Task Descriptions Due Date 1 Proposal Your research question and background introduction 5th Nov. 2 Data analysis The results for data manipulation and data visualization 3th Dec. 3 Final report A short report of your project 19th Dec. 6.3 Proposal In this part, you will need to submit the proposal file (either word or pdf). The instructor will give you feedback but will not grade this part. The rubic is just for helping you check the requirements. Item Research question and description of research question is clear Background introduction is related to the research topic and could support that the research question is valid and meaningful Clearly state the data sources (what is the dataset, where do you find it, what variables you will use from this dataset) State the potential method you will use for data analysis (descriptive analysis, simple regression, etc.) The proposal should be less than one page (not including citation), 12 font size, and single space. 6.4 Data analysis In this part you will submit your dataset, codes, and the file (either word or pdf) including the figures generated by the codes, the tables, and results descripiton in bullet points.
