In this course, we will use RStudio to do all the course stuff. So please make sure you install both two! R could be downloaded here and RStudio could be downloaded here. 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of R Studio Below is the figure showing a screenshot of the user interface of RStudio. You will find couple of panes/windows with different usages. Manu/Tool Bar Source The pane where you write and edit your code. Environment/History Environment lists all the variables that you are using. History presents the codes you have runned before. Console Console is original R interactive window. You could input codes and see the results here. Plots/Help Plots window shows the output figures. Help windows presents the information of the function or package you check. 2.5 Create and save R file Three ways to create a R file in the RStudio: 1. Manu -&gt; File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N 3. Tool Bar -&gt; New file button Also three ways to save R file 1. Manu -&gt; File -&gt; Save 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + S 3. Tool Bar -&gt; Save file button 2.6 Print Hello, world Now, let’s try to input some codes and run them! Let’s let R print the very classic “Hello, world!” with print() function. We could run the codes in several ways: Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and click the Run button located in the right-top position of the console pane. Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and use shortcut: Ctrl + Enter You could also click the Re-run button near the Run button to re-run the codes you runned last time print(&#39;Hello, world!&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Because what we need to output here is a string varible, we have to put them in the quotation mark. Either single quotation or double quotation mark works well. Let’s see another example. print(5928) ## [1] 5928 Here, 5928 is an integer and we do not need to put them in the quotation mark. 2.7 Install and use R Packages R is easy to use because it has many packages with different usages. These packages could help you acomplish some complex tasks with several lines of codes. Some packages have been already been installed and you could use them directly. However, most of the packages have to be installed before you want to use them. There are couple of ways you could install a package. Let’s take the gbm package for example. 1. Manu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Install Packages... -&gt; Input the package name -&gt; Click Install button 2. Use the code below: install.packages(&quot;gbm&quot;) After the installation of the package, you have import the it with library() function before you use the functions in it. library(gbm) ## Loaded gbm 2.1.4 We will spend more time in the future classes to explore the various R packages and their different usages. 2.8 Make notes It is important to write notes for your codes. It could help others or even yourself understand your codes easily. Use hash tag to indicate the notes. For example, gbm1 &lt;- gbm(AvgMet~PkAreaH+StpNumH+DisToMin, # formula data=MetM, # dataset var.monotone=c(+1, rep(0,10),rep(0,15)), distribution=&quot;gaussian&quot;, # see the help for other choices n.trees=5000, # number of trees shrinkage=0.001, # shrinkage or learning rate, 0.001 to 0.1 usually work interaction.depth=6, # 1: additive model, 2: two-way interactions, etc. bag.fraction = 0.5, # subsampling fraction, 0.5 is probably best n.minobsinnode = 10, # minimum total weight needed in each node cv.folds = 5) R will not run the codes after hash tags in each line. Please try to write simple but necessary notes for the codes. Keep this as a good habbit and you will thank yourself in the future. 2.9 Tips (Updating) You could divide your codes into sections by interting chunks before each sections with the shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + R. This will help you organize your codes. 2.10 Reference Introduction to RStudio "]
